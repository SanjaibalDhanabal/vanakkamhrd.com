                   <p class="mb-2">Low skills perpetuate poverty and inequality. When done right, skills development can reduce un- and underemployment, increase productivity, and improve standards of living. Helping people develop and update their skills makes economic sense.</p>
                   <p class="mb-2">Skills development is generally used to refer to the pro- ductive capabilities acquired through all levels of learning and training, occurring in formal, non-formal, informal and on-the-job settings.</p>
                   <p class="mb-2">Skill development and training helps instill emotional maturity in pupils. Learning new skills requires students to be willing to experiment. While doing so, they might face failures and disappointments but that will eventually prepare them to accept failures gracefully and develop a 'never give up' attitude.</p>
