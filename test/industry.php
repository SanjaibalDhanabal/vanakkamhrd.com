            <p class="mb-2">Industry institute interaction is essential for ensuring that practice meets theory across all functional areas. It goes a long way in enhancing a student's interpersonal skills and making him/her industry-ready. Such interactions are not always limited to just case discussions or internships. Industry-institute interaction activities like panels and summits may also be organized by institutes to bring together thinkers, experts and practitioners so that students can massively benefit from intensive mentoring by enthusiastic and highly committed industry professionals.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">These interactions help to tackle the doubts and concerns that students usually have about the industry. It gives them in-depth knowledge about what they can expect and how they have to groom themselves to achieve successes. With an industry-institute partnership cell, in college, all such issues can be taken care of even before students graduate. This does not leave them stranded after the graduation results are out and they have the confidence that they can take their theoretical (and practical) knowledge ahead to carve out a niche for themselves in their chosen industry.</p>
